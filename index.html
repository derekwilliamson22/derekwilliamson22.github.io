      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p> a full stack engineer is an opportunity to bring together a resourceful mind, 
      a curious spirit, and a practical set of skills to creatively solve problems. I am interested 
      in doing work that endures, so I'm drawn to companies or organizations whose focus is on doing 
      work for the environment or other socially responsible campaigns. I am extremely flexible and
      capable of working collaboratively as well as independently. And if my work for Prime Digital
      Academy has shown, I'm willing to fully devote myself in order to see a project, in this case,
      a pivot in my own career, to a compelling conclusion. My experience in academia has given me
      the skills to do diligent research, and as an educator, become an effective leader and project
      manager. Additionally, working in hospitality has strengthened my skills as a empathetic citizen,
      someone who is capable of delivering quality service while managing the expectations of both my employer and my guests. Moving forward, I'd like to spend my time working on learning and adapting to the inevitable changes in technology, so that I can always be relied upon as a committed colleague and dependable teammate.</p>
